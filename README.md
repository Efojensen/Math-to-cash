# Math-to-cash

Everyone knows the current situation we find ourselves in. We all want money and we want it now. This neccesity for us to obtain this
entity called money drives us to do many risky and, yes let's face it, stupid things. Things like betting (which mostly puts us on the wrong end of the stick),
prostitution(which adds to the rapid decline of morals and commitment), armed robbery and so much more. As university students, we are pressured on top of it all,
to also attain good grades so that we can make ourselves and "mama proud".
One now sees the painful reality that university students find themselves in. As young and schooling adults, they must attain the grades to move them forward in life
and they must also attain the money to adequately take care of themselves without calling home every week and listenig to parent's incessant complaining.
That's where this app comes in.
Imagine if you could use one of the most infamous subjects ever known to man to actually help student's make some money for themselves.
You guessed right, mathematics. This mobile app, math to cash, seeks to integrate the knowledge of mathematics acquired over the years with actual financial problems
that many students face and, in context, "kill two birds with one stone". Thus, the student is entitled to receive a significant amount of additional money as per the initial 
amount deposited after a certain percentage of total questions has been answered completely. This will lead to an increase of many student's performance in math because they will literally see that they need this unjustly hated subject to live. ;-)
I plan to add more subjects later but I currently don't have any since students like to cheat and all the others are subject to cheating to those who have multiple devices and
Chat gpt.
So yeah that's it.
